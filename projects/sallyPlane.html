			<h2>The Challenge</h2>
			<p>After a year of building several RC planes—from scratch-built experimental models to modified gliders—I
				faced a persistent problem: durability and reliability. Seeking a more precise and repeatable
				construction method, I delved into the world of 3D-printed aeronautics. The goal was clear: build the
				best plane I’ve ever owned and, more importantly, bring it back home in one piece.</p>

			<h2>Manufacturing Process</h2>
			<p>Without prior experience in printed planes, I chose a model from <strong>Eclipson</strong> and began a
				non-stop printing marathon. The fuselage was printed using high-resistance PLA from <strong>Sakata
					3D</strong>, ensuring structural integrity for the main body.</p>
			<p>For the wings, weight was the priority. I opted for <strong>Lightweight PLA</strong>, which allowed me to
				save 50% of the weight compared to standard filament. To counteract lift forces, the wings were
				reinforced with three mandatory carbon fiber tubes, preventing upward bending during high-stress
				maneuvers.</p>

			<h2>Integration & Electronics</h2>
			<p>The assembly followed a rigorous PDF protocol, using specialized glues and steel reinforcements. A
				critical addition was the custom landing gear, essential for ensuring safe returns. This five-channel
				aircraft (elevator, ailerons, motor, rudder, and flaps) required a total of six servos.</p>

			<blockquote>
				"Engineering is about solving unexpected problems. When my recycled radio couldn't synchronize the
				flaps, an Arduino-based signal inverter saved the mission."
			</blockquote>

			<p>One of the main technical hurdles was the flaps' synchronization. Due to my hardware limitations, I
				designed an <strong>Arduino-based solution</strong> to read the receiver signal and invert it for the
				corresponding servo, restoring full flap functionality.</p>

			<h2>Flight Results</h2>
			<p>Christened as <strong>"Sally"</strong>, the aircraft underwent a strict pre-flight checklist at the local
				airfield. The maiden flight was a success. The plane demonstrated exceptional stability and "floated"
				through the air, capturing high-altitude footage through stripped-down action cameras integrated into
				the fuselage.</p>
			<p>This project proves that with precision manufacturing and creative problem-solving, high-end aeronautics
				are accessible to the maker community.</p>
